# Rulebook Node
Responsible for managing Exonym nodes, this repository is a critical component of the Decentralised Rulebook system. 
It provides the infrastructure for Sources and Advocates to deploy rulebooks, and enables the system to operate in a 
fully decentralised manner.

The Exonym node management software is designed to be secure, fault-tolerant, and scalable. It ensures that rulebooks 
are deployed and executed correctly across the network, and that the system remains highly available and responsive 
at all times. The software is responsible for managing the consensus mechanism that ensures all nodes on the network 
agree on the state of the system, and for enforcing the rules of the various rulebooks that are deployed.

__Steps to Production Ready System:__ 

- Active corporate Sybil Registry activated.
- Trustworthy-Sources-Rulebook activated together with the ability to prove honesty to self-list as a Source.
