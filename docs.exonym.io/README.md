# Exonym Document Repository
Welcome to our document repository, also available at https://docs.exonym.io. Here you will find a wealth of information 
about our project, but please note that we are actively updating it!

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at [hello@exonym.io](mailto:hello@exonym.io)

Our repository consists of two core repositories with multiple sub-projects. The first is the `rulebook-node` repository,
which is currently in the testing phase. The second is the `exonymwallet` repository, which is currently in development. 
We expect to release a command line tool shortly.

It is important to note that there is a difference in the licensing of our documentation and code repositories. 
Our documentation, which is available on https://docs.exonym.io, is published under the Mozilla Public License, 
which allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute the documentation. On the other hand, our code repository, 
which can be found in our GitHub repositories, is published under a modified MIT license that we refer to as the Exonym 
license. This license allows users to Freely use, modify, and distribute the code with a restriction on circumventing 
Exonym's Sybil service.

You must also agree to the Identity Mixer License which is also included in our repository.

> _It's important to carefully review the specific terms of each license before using any of our materials._

This page serves as a central location for all release notes for the Exonym project. As we continue to develop and 
improve our products, we will regularly update this page with information on new features, bug fixes, and other
