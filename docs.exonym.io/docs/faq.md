# What's the difference between Exonym, Smart Contracts, and Blockchain?
Exonym, Smart Contracts, and Blockchain Transactions are all 
technologies that enable transactions to occur in a trustworthy 
manner without centralized control. However, there are many
differences between these technologies.

Blockchains are decentralized ledgers that record 
all transactions in a transparent and immutable way. Transactions 
on a blockchain are secured by a network of nodes that validate 
each transaction and add it to the ledger. They
can be used for a wide range of applications, including financial 
transactions, supply chain management, and voting systems.

Smart Contracts are self-executing contracts that automatically 
enforce the terms of an agreement. They are typically built on 
top of a blockchain platform and are executed by the nodes in 
the network. Smart Contracts can be used for a wide range of 
applications, including financial transactions, real estate, 
and supply chain management. Smart Contracts provide a high level 
of transparency and immutability, as they are recorded on a public 
blockchain.

Exonym is an identity system that enables a governance framework 
to facilitate secure transactions without centralized control. 
This is achieved through the installation of Rulebook Nodes by 
web users to govern transactions. Each Rulebook necessitates 
regulators (web users) to establish a robust reputation system 
so that they can enforce the rules. The reliability of 
transactions in Exonym is high because Rulebooks are 
rooted in a public and immutable rulebook document, and if any 
legitimate part of society is underrepresented, they can 
add what is missing to ensure inclusivity.

While all three technologies enable trustworthy transactions 
without centralized control, they differ in their approach. 
Smart Contracts and Blockchain Transactions rely on the technology 
itself to provide trust, while Exonym relies on people and processes 
to define and enforce rules, which is closer to the real-world.
Additionally, while Smart Contracts and Blockchain Transactions 
provide high levels of transparency, they do not address the issue 
of long-dated trust. Exonym, on the other hand, enables long-dated 
trust by providing a governance system that can adapt and change with 
evolving attitudes.

# Isn't this Centralization?
The notion that rulebooks are centralized is a baseless claim. While it may seem that rulebooks will be created
and maintained by a group of individuals or a central authority; this does not mean that they are centralized
in nature. In fact, rulebooks can be inherited by other Sources, and these Sources can enable their own Advocates to
follow the same set of rules.

As long as the new source follows the same Trustworthy-Sources rulebook, there is nothing stopping it from enabling
other entities to abide by the same rules. This is an important feature of rulebooks because it allows for a
wider adoption of rules and promotes consistency across multiple sources. The decentralized nature of rulebooks
ensures that they are not beholden to a single entity or group, and that they can evolve and adapt to changing circumstances.

In conclusion, the idea that rulebooks are centralized is a fallacy. While they may be created and maintained by a
central authority, rulebooks can be inherited by other sources, enabling a wider adoption of rules and promoting
plurality. The decentralised nature of rulebooks ensures that they are not tied to a single entity or group,
and that they can evolve and adapt to meet the needs of the wider community.

## The Source
Sources, which refer to groups or individuals, are centered around a Rulebook. However, the Rulebook does not belong
to any specific entity. Any person or group can identify themselves as a Source by referencing the Rulebook and
gathering like-minded Advocates to support their cause. To become an Advocate, a person or group can align themselves
with a Source and identify themselves as such. Therefore, Rulebooks are highly decentralized systems that offer equal
opportunities to everyone involved.


## Sybil
To put it simply, Rulebooks are not centralized. There is an identity system called Exonym, there is a collection
of Rulebooks and there is Sybil.

Sybil is a system that governs clone accounts and is naturally centralized because it needs to be reliable. It
wouldn't make sense to decentralize it since Rulebook Systems depend on it to ensure accountability.

If you can find a fairer, cheaper, safer, way of transacting; use it.  The web is yours to build on.

## TLDR
> **Rulebooks are a maximally decentralized systems, with equal opportunities.**
>
> They are not systems of _equality_.

# Aren't decentralized systems supposed to be ... ?
## Everyone needs to be equal!
There is no agreed criteria of what a decentralized system _needs_ to be.

Logic says that a decentralized system would either have to have
the initial condition of being decentralized, or progress
towards decentralization.

> Rulebooks tend towards decentralization.

Here's a universal fact that we should all embrace and moreover learn
to love.

> We are all unique and that makes some of us better than others at some
> things.

Our objective is to create systems with equal opportunities, not
systems of equality.

Consider an arbitrary game, where everyone is equal and players
compete for some resource.  On an open, anonymous, permissionless system,
it would be very difficult (perhaps impossible) to define a set of
enforceable rules that prevented collaboration to win more resource.
And so people collaborate and skew the odds in their collective favour.
That is why distributed systems, that have an initial condition of
being maximally decentralized, tend towards centralization.

__The Problem__

When a product or service is optional, there aren't really many problems
with autocracy. Companies all over the world are in many cases
little dictatorships.

On the web the problem isn't doing something, it's what the _thing_ becomes.
It invades our lives and coerces us to use it.  Today, not having a smartphone
is caste creating and this isn't an isolated incident.  It's just
a new reality we need to organize around.

We use Google Search because it's good. It's the best. Literally no one
could be better because no one can capture their _current_ market
position as an initial condition.

If we split Google Search into two competitive companies,
one would eventually win and we'd end up with Search with the
same problems, by another name.

__So how do we incentivize decentralization?__

Consider how much the EU's "Right to be forgotten" law is a pain for Google.
The entire world and their personal baggage at your door screaming _"someone wrote
something about me and it's on the Internet!"_

Under a system of Rulebooks, that's no longer their problem and they can
get on with earning money.

# What about governments?

Some are good.

They should all be good.

## Do you see this as the start of the end of Governments?

Absolute nonsense.

- While it is still possible to commit a crime in real life, we'll need Governments.
- Rulebooks rely on the laws of sovereign nations.
- Rulebooks rely on the referencing of international laws.
- Rulebooks are designed for governing the minutia of web transactions.
- Rulebooks are designed to impose network rules with much higher standards than the laws of nations.
- Rulebooks are not designed for imposing accountability for criminal actions.
- Who will promote competitive markets, if not Governments?

If you have a great vision for a future free of Governments, you should
watch YouTube.

## Pre-conceptions
#### Self-Sovereign-Identity
We do not use the term Self-Sovereign-Identity to avoid misconceptions with W3C's Verifiable Credentials and the work 
of the Linux Foundation, The Ethereum Foundation, and Microsoft.

#### Blockchain
There is no blockchain (yet) and for many reasons, but primarily they require a lot of resource.  Systems that require 
non-negligible resource forces the system owner to seek revenue to support the system, which makes it easier to corrupt. 

#### Standards
Exonym's objective is to enable accountable anonymous transactions on the Internet and while much of the cryptography underpinning Exonym is the same as SSI systems and users are
autonomous, Exonym is a __system__ and not a __standard__.

# A final note
Most of us have been raised with the idea of obedience ingrained in us. From a young age, we're taught to follow rules 
and do what we're told without questioning why. This conditioning often continues into our adult lives, where we find 
ourselves following authority figures blindly, even when it doesn't benefit us.

Rulebooks provide a different approach. Rulebooks don't require obedience from its users. Instead, it presents itself 
as a tool that users can choose to use or not use. You can think of it like a castle with an open door - you can come and 
go as you please. There's no need to obey anyone or anything.

If you choose to leave the castle, you're free to explore the wild world of the Internet. But you'll also face the 
risks and threats that come with it. Within the castle, you have the protections that the Rulebook offers. It provides 
a set of rules and guidelines to follow, that try and ensure that you're _"safe"_.

Rulebooks are a unique approach to authority. It allows users to have the freedom to choose, 
while still providing structure and protection. It's a refreshing change from the traditional conditioning of obedience 
that we've grown up with. By using Rulebooks, we empower ourselves to make our own choices.  

A web run by web users. We should probably call it a democracy.
