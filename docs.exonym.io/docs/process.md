# Process & Philosophical Justification
> Grand ideas require grand evidence and today, that is what's missing. We accept 
that we are not there yet.

This page discusses and justifies why decentralized rulebooks should be adopted to 
facilitate a richer information sphere. 

We detail some of the target problems, how rulebooks address those 
problems, and how it is compatible with liberal-democratic society.

# Internet Governance _on_ the Web
Our Internet is a maximally distributed and yet singular system 
that is forcing our societies to organise into one group.

So far, this organisation has tended towards non-democratic, 
libertarian forms of governance; where the capture of a network 
utility, not only leads to the ownership 
of a service or infrastructure, but also the governance of it. 
Facebook and Twitter govern free speech, YouTube governs copyright law... 
it's easy to see and they do it on request... by governments who don't yet know 
how we can govern the web.  Governments call them 'intermediaries'.

Against the political backdrop of the world’s liberal democracies, 
we have elevated corporations above our countries. We didn't 
ask for it, it just happened - but we no longer all have control 
over how we're governed.

In the context of free market capitalism, it has facilitated 
the capture of broad aspects of our online lives, from consumer 
trade, information discovery, to the ‘village square’. 

Our societies are diverging from capitalism’s basic premise of 
_the voluntary exchange of goods and services_ because access 
to some online utilities can be caste creating.  Think how
disadvantaged you would be without a smartphone and now consider
how you network online and the companies you use to do it. 

We need companies and we need their services; on the one hand 
it's great... lots of cool stuff.  On the other, we shouldn't _need_ 
them. That's a problem.

Normal web users are being squeezed between despots 
and libertarians. The despots want to limit our freedoms.  The libertarians
want to limit our ability to transact without them.

It's tempting to think that it's an East versus West thing; but it's 
not.  There's both on both sides.  

___What can be done about it?___ 

In the real world, a government’s power comes from physical 
restriction; from the seizure of assets to a person’s arrest.
In the online world, a utility’s power comes from 
allowing user access.  

The logical solution is to ___democratize privileged action___. The right place
for it to be democratized in on the technology stack.

The core premise of Decentralized Rulebooks is to facilitate the separation
of __governance__ from __utility__.  It is a small
change, but one that will make a large difference to our online world.

# Open, Distributed and _Permissionless_
The web is often hailed as an open, distributed, and permissionless space, where 
individuals can freely access and share information without any restrictions. 
Some argue that enabling "privileged action" on the web would contradict 
this ethos. It is important to note that rulebooks do not undermine the web's 
openness, but rather uphold the principle of accountability.

In the real world, individuals can act against the law, but they still face 
consequences. Similarly, by agreeing to a rulebook, individuals expose 
themselves to potential privilege loss. While rulebooks are designed to 
be open for anyone to agree to, they do come with restrictions that must 
be followed. This doesn't undermine the web's permissionless nature since 
individuals can still choose whether or not to agree to the rulebook.

Enforcing rules and holding individuals accountable for their actions 
online ultimately increases freedom for the majority by creating a safer 
online environment. The lack of accountability is a pervasive issue on 
the web, with too much emphasis placed on the accountability of platforms 
rather than individuals. Platforms are primarily for-profit companies, 
and pretending otherwise leads to dissonance.

In conclusion, enabling privileged action through rulebooks does not contradict 
the web's openness and permissionless nature. Instead, it upholds the principle 
of accountability and creates a safer online environment for all. It is important 
to recognize that accountability ultimately lies with individuals, not just 
platforms, and to strive for a balance between individual freedom and responsibility.

# The _Right_ to Govern
The Internet has revolutionized the way people interact, communicate, 
and do business. However, the current state of the web is being severely 
limited by the efforts of businesses and countries to control the online 
environment. This is mainly because the web is a global network of territorial 
transactions, and it's inescapable. Thus, dissonance is quite natural when we 
apply systems that aren't compatible with what's happening in real life.

There are two paths that we can choose for the web. We can either have a purely 
global network or a global network with regional regulations. If we choose the 
global network, we are essentially choosing a lawless one. Most laws are defined 
or interpreted by nations, and no country governs the web. This lawlessness leads 
to users searching for integrity, and this fact has elevated corporations above 
nations.

Integrity is clearly wanted, or Big Tech would be less successful than they are. 
Therefore, it is safe to assume that an internet with laws is more valuable 
than a lawless one. However, corporations have no right to govern the world, 
yet that is what they are doing today.

Here, we assert that within strict constraints, some can stake a claim to 
govern the world. For instance, consider an NGO that supports press freedoms. 
They empower the world’s press to control misinformation in news media. It 
seems logical that a macro control is rightly placed above that of nations 
and is subservient to international law. More palatable still is if the 
organizations responsible for micro control are established in the same 
nation as those who are being controlled.

This configuration is compatible with a global network of territorial 
transactions, but it isn't necessary to establish the right to govern. 
It is only necessary when governance has already been established, i.e., 
existing regulations. The NGO can't reasonably force itself onto the world’s 
press, meaning that the industry granted them the right to govern. Without 
enough journalists using the rulebook, it wouldn't be useful. The act of 
joining grants the Advocate the right to govern under the stated context, 
but only when the journalist stands to benefit from the governance.

Such an arrangement is objectively fair. Therefore, within the limits 
dictated by the narrow scope of the rulebook and given that those limits 
require consensus to be meaningful, we can say that everyone has the right 
to govern the world. That is, to govern a small aspect of the web in a way 
that is above that of nations.

Such a broad and equitable freedom negates any need for a worldwide web 
government. Instead, there would exist many independent caretakers of 
narrowly scoped and independent rules, controlled by regional interpretations 
and used only when beneficial. 

This type of governance would allow for 
innovation on the web while still maintaining the integrity that users desire. 
It would also allow for a more equitable distribution of power, preventing any 
one entity from becoming too dominant. 

By embracing this model, we can ensure that the Internet remains a dynamic 
and open platform for growth and progress.


# Voluntary Governance as a Benefit
Governance is a central theme in this thesis, and it is worth examining in detail. 
The key democratic feature of rulebooks is that all controls are voluntary. If 
a control does not result in a net gain in freedom for both producers and consumers, 
then it serves only to control. Although some may argue that control is sometimes 
beneficial, we can ignore such debates due to a hard limit imposed by the Internet. 
When total control is absent, this limit is usually reached. Thus, we need to answer 
whether total control would advance or hinder humanity.

Assuming that democracy is more socially advanced than autocracy, we can consider 
a scenario where a controller captures and reads all network traffic. To achieve 
total control, this is a necessary precondition. We can also imagine that we have 
established trust in a democratic "Internet police."

If we'd done this, an attacker could physically attack the organization or take 
it over politically. Despite security measures in place to prevent this, such an 
attack is desirable and likely to occur. The most probable outcome would be a 
global autocracy.

In conclusion, total control of a singular network like the Internet would 
objectively pose a significant threat to democracy and likely regress it. 
We can confidently define the hard limit to Internet governance because beyond 
it, a workaround will always exist.

- ___The most we can offer are protections that we elect to use to increase consumer 
confidence in a transaction.___

As Internet governors we face a forced enlightenment. A basis of governance 
is that people surrender freedoms in return for protections; however, 
if we only surrender them to transact, we can define controls that are only 
instantaneously acceptable. Therefore, our offer of protection must be of 
benefit to someone in some case.

The tenet is that producers expose themselves to potential loss of privilege 
to increase the number of people to transact with.


# Anonymity 
Anonymity has always been a contentious issue in the digital age, especially 
when it comes to online transactions. However, in order for a rulebook to 
truly be voluntary, it is essential that there be a possibility of anonymity 
for users. This is because a proof of honesty must be without prejudice from 
other transactions. If it is prejudiced by previous or unrelated infringements, 
it can limit individual progress. Therefore, any proof must be anonymous and 
un-linkable to other proofs.

The possibility of anonymity online is crucial because it allows individuals to 
participate in online transactions without fear of repercussions. For instance, in
some countries, expressing certain opinions or ideas can lead to legal 
consequences or social ostracism. However, with the option of anonymity, 
individuals can freely express their thoughts and engage in discussions 
without fear of being targeted. In this way, anonymity online fosters a 
culture of free speech and expression.

Furthermore, the possibility of anonymity also protects users from cybercrime 
and other online threats. Cybercriminals often target individuals based on 
their personal information, such as their name, address, and financial details. 
By using anonymous transactions, individuals can protect their personal 
information and prevent themselves from becoming targets of cybercrime.

The option for anonymity online should not be exploited to engage in illegal 
or unethical activities, as anonymity should be used responsibly and with 
consideration for the safety and rights of others. In other words, anonymity 
should not be a tool for harassment, hate speech, or cyberbullying. This is 
where rulebooks come into their full effect; users can be anonymous and 
still be accountable.

In conclusion, the possibility of anonymity online is crucial for the proper 
functioning of voluntary rulebooks. Anonymity allows individuals to participate 
freely in online transactions and discussions without fear of repercussions 
or becoming targets of cybercrime. However, it is important to use anonymity 
responsibly and with consideration for the safety and rights of others. 
By doing so, we can cultivate a culture of free speech and expression while 
still maintaining a safe and secure online environment.

# Voting
Voting is often seen as a cornerstone of democratic systems. It is 
a way for individuals to have their voices heard and to collectively 
make decisions. However, when it comes to online systems, voting 
can be ineffective and unfair for several reasons.

One of the main issues with online voting is that it can lead to the 
belief that just because someone voted for something at some point 
in time, it is valid forever. This is problematic because people's 
beliefs, needs, and desires can change over time, and what was once 
a popular choice may no longer be the best option. Rulebooks handle these
changes by allowing people to choose how they are going to transact 
based on a diverse selection of Advocates.

Another issue with online voting is that it can exclude individuals 
who were not able to participate at the time of the vote. Just 
because someone was not able to vote at the time of the decision 
does not mean that their beliefs or desires should be invalidated. 
In order to truly represent a democratic system, online democracy must 
be flexible enough to allow individuals to participate at any time 
and ensure that everyone's voice is heard; again rulebooks facilitate
this through the ability to choose an advocate, install a Source or 
Advocate for an existing rulebook, and even write a new rulebook.

Moreover, voting for someone to represent you every four years 
is not the same as voting on everything that happens everywhere. 
There are countless decisions that impact people's lives every day, 
and it is not feasible to have everyone vote on each one. Rulebooks
balance the need for representation and efficiency and encourage
participation in the important decisions that impact their lives.

Lastly, voter fatigue is a real issue with online voting. With the 
increasing number of decisions that require voting, individuals 
can quickly become overwhelmed and disinterested in participating. 
This can lead to decisions being made by a small group of people, 
which is not representative of a democratic system. 

Despite these challenges, voting still has its place in small 
technocratic systems like Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). 
In these systems, the number of voters is limited, and the consequences 
of the vote are contained. However, when it comes to larger systems 
with thousands of individuals impacted by the decision, online voting 
alone cannot be relied upon to ensure that democracy is truly represented.

In conclusion, while online voting can be useful in certain 
circumstances, it is not always effective or fair in larger 
systems. To ensure that everyone's voice is heard and that 
democracy is truly represented.  A web run by people must be flexible, 
dynamic, and allow participation at any time. Only then can we create 
truly democratic online systems.

# Liberal & Democratic
In today's world, the internet has become an integral part of our lives. It 
has revolutionized the way we communicate, conduct business, and access 
information. However, with this tremendous power comes great responsibility, 
and many have been grappling with how to regulate this powerful tool in 
a way that is fair, equitable, and democratic.

Rulebooks offer a democratic internet to everyone who uses it, where continuous 
democracy emerges through selection.

Users and services elect to use controls that apply only for the transaction. 
This means the control must offer some benefit but also means that we can 
create arbitrarily high standards without making the web too restrictive. 

As a consumer, one can select all sources by default and deselect sources 
and advocates that are found to be inappropriate. As a producer, one 
can select advocates who most closely align with their values. Services 
select rulebooks most appropriate to the transaction and deselect 
sources and advocates who fail to offer protections. Advocates select 
a source that is most in line with their values, and a source selects 
(or develops) a rulebook document that is most broadly appropriate 
to the target problem.

Rulebooks offer direct democracy without voting, where radical 
choices limit the size of the consuming audience, and illegal 
choices result in an inability to find services.

If a producer can select their own choice of advocate, 
then there is an elective process. They selected how they want to 
be governed, and through doing so, they communicate their values 
to other people who can select whether they want to interact with 
that person. This enables individuals to exercise their freedom of 
choice and have a say in how they want to be governed.

If part of society is marginalized by the control, that section of 
society can set up their own controls to be included. This freedom to 
contribute is the very definition of democratization, run by the people. 
However, the system doesn't ensure that all users have equal access to 
the selections. Hence, policymakers need to ensure that people have equal 
access to the selections. When deploying the rulebooks, there needs to be 
a framework in place to monitor and control them, and that framework 
needs to be democratic.

Finally, it is essential to note that utilities still have a lot of 
power, and if they overreach and start imposing biased rules, it is 
effortless for countries, policymakers, and NGOs to identify the rules 
that are being applied and to change them in accordance with how we 
want society to run. It is very easy to change the rulebooks or 
deploy new ones to ensure the proper application of regional 
regulations within this framework. On the other hand, when rules 
are defined and imposed solely by private enterprise, it is very 
difficult. Therefore, the use of rulebooks in the internet space 
can provide a transparent and democratic means of regulating the 
internet while ensuring equal access and participation for all.

# Consumer Selections
 _"Prove honesty and get on with it."_

The internet is a vast space where the vast majority of users have no 
ill intent and are not trying to break any rules. For these users, 
anything designed to stop bad actors can be a hassle. To make it easier 
for them to interact with rulebooks, the process should be simple and 
straightforward - users should be able to select all and only filter 
when they have a particular opinion or need.

The Advocates associated with the rulebooks are all identified and 
bound to their respective jurisdictions. They have a legal obligation 
to act responsibly and follow the rules, and if they do anything illegal, 
they can be prosecuted. This is what currently doesn't exist on the web - accountability.

Therefore, most users will have no issues with selecting all Sources 
for all rulebooks and only filtering when they have an opinion. The 
system has been designed to protect both people and the Sources, and 
the accountability of the Advocates ensures that everyone is following 
the rules. The only area of concern is where there may be state-sanctioned 
malevolent rulebooks, but this is not an "Internet problem," and it 
should not be treated as such. Instead, it should be addressed on a 
legal and regulatory level.

# Appeals
The appeals process is an important part of any system that relies on 
judgments and decisions made by individuals or groups. In this particular 
system, the appeals process is triggered when a producer is revoked by an 
advocate associated with the source. In such a scenario, the source becomes 
responsible for handling the final appeal.

While this process is largely manual, it is designed to be transparent and 
fair. When a revoked producer decides to appeal the decision, they must 
provide all relevant data, including the transaction data and the response 
from the initial appeal, via their wallet. Additionally, the producer must 
pay the associated fee to initiate the appeal.

Once the evidence has been submitted, the source will review the information 
provided and then make a final judgment. It is important to note that the 
judgment reached through this process is only considered final in the 
context of the online appeals procedure. If either the advocate or the 
producer is unsatisfied with the outcome, there is an option for further 
action via an offline legal path.

Overall, the appeals process is an essential part of ensuring that the 
decisions made within this system are fair and just. While it may not 
always be perfect, it is designed to provide a transparent and reliable 
mechanism for resolving disputes and ensuring that everyone involved is 
held accountable for their actions. By carefully considering all of the 
evidence and taking a thoughtful approach to decision-making, the source 
can help to ensure that the appeals process is as effective as possible.

# Efficient Online Transactions: The Importance of Balancing Cost and Decentralization
Efficient transactions online are becoming increasingly important in today's digital 
age. The emergence of blockchain technology and Proof of Stake (PoS) has revolutionized 
the way we conduct transactions online. PoS has significantly reduced transactional 
costs from 84,000 to 35 watt-hours (Wh). Although 35Wh is still higher than the 
negligible transaction cost associated with centralized systems, it is orders of 
magnitude better than its previous counterpart.

In a free-market economy, centralised systems have a competitive advantage over 
decentralized ones until the benefits of decentralization outweigh the costs. 
With reduced transactional costs, decentralization is becoming a more attractive 
option for market participants.

Exonym, for instance, offers negligible transactional costs because the user 
computes the token, and the verification of these simplified proofs can execute 
in milliseconds. This makes it an ideal framework for 
microtransactions, where the transaction value is often small. The small 
cost associated with managing Rulebooks is also desirable, as it implies 
a motivation to offer market participants protection.

Although the primary driver must be an offer of governance, making these 
protections profitable will increase the incentive to offer similar protections 
in the future. This creates a positive cycle where more protections are offered, 
increasing the attractiveness of the framework, leading to more users, and 
further increasing the value of the information sphere.

Moreover, efficient transactions online are essential for enabling the 
participation of a broader spectrum of society. In developing countries, 
where financial infrastructure is often inadequate, trustworthy transactions
can enable financial inclusion by offering a secure and efficient way of 
people interacting. This could lead to a more equitable and inclusive 
society, where everyone has access to the transactional integrity they need.

In conclusion, efficient transactions online are crucial for the growth 
and success of digital platforms. PoS has revolutionized the way we 
conduct transactions online by securing the transfer of decentralised assets.
Rulebooks offers long-dated transactional integrity at negligible 
transactional costs, so that regulation in the DeFi space isn't an afterthought. 

The importance of efficient transactions online extends beyond just 
financial inclusion. It can lead to a more equitable 
and inclusive society, where everyone has access to financial services.
