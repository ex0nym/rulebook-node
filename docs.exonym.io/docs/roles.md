# Exonym Roles
Thoughout this documentation, we use bespoke role names such as Source, 
Advocate, Producer, and Consumer to define the specific roles involved 
in governing transactions. 

We begin with two key roles: __Rulebook Document Authors__ and Sources.
A Rulebook Document Author can be anyone who can write a rulebook 
that gains widespread agreement.

A __Source__ is an identified web user who is interested in 
governing the web according to a specific rulebook. 
They are typically trusted and believed to independently 
support some aspect of society. 

Sources onboard __Advocates__, who fall under a jurisdiction and 
help resolve the problem of a global network facilitating regional 
transactions.

We then look at the three categories of users: Utilities, Producers, 
and Consumers. 

- __Utilities__ are internet services such as social networks, 
search engines, and payment systems. 

- __Producers__ are web users who add something to the internet, such as 
publishing a website or offering a product or service. 

- __Consumers__ are 
individuals who consume content or services from the internet, such 
as reading a website or buying a product.

Rulebooks are activated when actors rally around them, as they provide 
a secure environment for transactions, and not using them becomes 
tedious.


# Controllers
## Rulebook Document Author
Anyone who wants to write one and can write it in a way that lots of 
people can agree with.

## Source
Any identified web user who has an interest in governing the web in the way defined by
the rulebook. 

A Source will often be someone who has a brand and (in their own way)
trusted and believed to independently support some aspect of society.


It's a spectrum from __Open Societies Foundations__ and __Luminate__
to __Alliance Defending Freedom__ and __Black Guns Matter__. 

> We can probably trust that Black Guns Matter support gun ownership rights.
> 
> _It's not whether you agree with them, or trust them in some other context.
> Facebook must be trustworthy when it comes to targeting ads, or they'll risk hurting their business_
> 

Sources are above Sovereign Nations in that they represent the 
international aspects of web governance.  

It's better if a Source is not a nation state, unless they
are applying rules that _only_ apply to people or activities that country.
In that case it's _good_ if they are a regulatory organization in a country.

Sources onboard Advocates who always fall under a jurisdiction.  This 
is how the _global network facilitating regional transactions_
problem is resolved.

Groups in the UN's IGF should be very keen on setting up Sources.

> __We can build systems that protect our own rights on the web.__

## Advocate
Any identified web user, who has aligned with a Source controlling
for a specific Rulebook.

They are interested in adding their interpretation to the network. 

We don't really go into the economics of Rulebooks here, but they 
need to be present.   There needs to be something in it for them. That
might be commercial, a network utility tax, or government supported.

Wherever finance comes into Rulebooks, we need to be careful that 
the right incentives have been defined to create a situation of 
good governance.
