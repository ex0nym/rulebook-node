# Sybil
Clone accounts on the internet pose serious issues, but solving them while maintaining user anonymity can have 
significant benefits for online trust and transparency. 

We don't believe that there's a single way to achieve 'safety' online, 
which is why we have created Decentralized Rulebooks. Rulebooks enable 
individuals who have ideas about how to address the issues of internet 
governance to do so without restriction.

# Exonym's Sybil Service
The Sybil service is a centralised application that provides clone-resistance through a one or two-level registration process.

The first level involves a remote onboarding process with anti-clone facial recognition, while the second level 
is an in-person onboarding service that stores fingerprints of registered users.

Biometrics are required for registration, and once completed, pseudonymous links are published to that identity.

The objectives of this service are to prevent the creation of duplicate accounts, provide the option to invalidate 
containers upon request from users (in case of a catastrophic reset) while maintaining accountability, prevent 
malicious invalidation, to treat multiple bot revocations as a single action, and more.

The service ensures accountability for actions taken by an authorised actor of a registered user.

# Coming Soon
Sybil enables a completely private, feature rich, and Internet-Wide privilege management system.

> Over the next few months we will be updating this page with features and benefits.
